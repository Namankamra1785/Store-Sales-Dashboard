# Store-Sales-Dashboard

This project served as a fantastic opportunity to refine my data handling skills:

🔍 Data Cleaning: Ensuring accuracy in datasets.
📊 Data Visualization: Crafting insightful representations.
📈 Data Analysis: Extracting meaningful conclusions.

Here are some compelling takeaways:

🌍 Women exhibit a 65% higher purchasing propensity compared to men.
🌍 The top 3 sales regions include Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
👩‍💼 The 30-49 age demographic contributes significantly, comprising around 50% of total sales.
💻 Predominant sales channels comprise Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.

Drawing from the analysis, it is evident that Bhagwati Stores can optimize sales by targeting female consumers aged 30-49 residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Leveraging targeted ads, enticing offers, and coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra could effectively stimulate sales growth.

Thrilled to showcase the strategic insights gained from this project! 🚀
